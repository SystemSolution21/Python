# Python Package Best Practices

It's not strictly necessary __init__py for every single directory, but it is a strong best practice for any directory intended to be an importable Python package.

## The Modern Rule: Namespace Packages

Since Python 3.3, a directory without an `__init__.py` file can still be treated as a package, known as a "namespace package".
This is what allows modern tooling (build tools combined with project configuration) to find the utils module even without an `__init__.py` file, once the project is installed in editable mode (`pip install -e .`).

## Should Still Use __init__.py (Best Practice)

Even though it's not always required, adding an empty `__init__.py` file to the package directories is highly recommended for several key reasons:

### Clarity and Intent

It explicitly and unambiguously marks a directory as a Python package. Anyone (or any tool) looking at the project immediately understands its structure.

### Prevents Errors

It prevents directories that are not meant to be packages (e.g., a folder of data files, documentation, or shell scripts) from being accidentally imported, which could cause confusing errors.

### Compatibility

Some older tools, linters, and IDEs still rely on the presence of `__init__.py` to correctly identify packages and provide features like auto-completion.

### Package Initialization

It gives a place to put package-level initialization code, define what `from package import *` does via `__all__`, or create package-level variables.
