# 5. Longest Common Subsequence

Understanding Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)
The Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) of two strings is the longest sequence of characters that appear in both strings in the same order but not necessarily consecutively.
For example:
Given text1 = "abcde" and text2 = "ace", the LCS is "ace" (length = 3).
Unlike Longest Common Substring, which requires contiguous characters, LCS allows characters to be non-adjacent but still in the same order.
